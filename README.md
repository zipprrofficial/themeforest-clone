Offering subscription or membership plans can create a steady revenue stream for platform owners. Sellers can pay for premium features, while buyers can access exclusive content or discounts through subscription models.

With the majority of users accessing online platforms via mobile devices, a responsive design is non-negotiable. The clone script should ensure seamless functionality across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
